    <h1 class="underline">Introduction to html</h1>
    <p>
        HTML (<span><strong>H</strong></span>ypertext <span><strong>M</strong></span>arkup <span><strong>L</strong>L</span>anguage) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 
        <br>
  <br> Ps It was invented by the physist Tim Berners-Lee the first version was created in 1993 </p1>
    <h2 class="underline">So what is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way,If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p2>

         <br>The main parts of our element are as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>The <strong>opening tag</strong>: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
        <li>The <strong>closing tag</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
        <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
        <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
